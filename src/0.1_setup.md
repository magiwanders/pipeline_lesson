## Setup

- Download the virtual machine complementary to the lesson [QUI](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1MIDXYVtsaYKxCYUdW-lFQ8cbkSl-Truh) (the file ```comparch.ova``` is relatively big at ~2.7GB)
- Download and install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> for your system.
- Open VirtualBox and import the file ```comparch.ova```:
    - ```File > Import Appliance```
    - Select the file ```comparch.ova```
    - Click ```Next```, click ```Import```
    - A new Virtual Machine should appear in the main window. Double click for booting it up.

## Software

This lesson will use the tools:
- ```S.H.E.A.S. (Simple Hardware Editor and Simulator)``` - A logic ports simulator also available [standalone](https://sheas.magiwanders.com). It will however be mostly embedded in the lesson pages.
- ```Ripes``` - a RISC-V processors simulator, available in the Virtual Machine.

Both the tools will feature tutorials later during the lesson:
- ```S.H.E.A.S.``` tutorial in the [Timing](./2_timing.md) section.
- ```Ripes``` tutorial in the [Building the Pipeline](./3_building_the_pipeline.md) section.
