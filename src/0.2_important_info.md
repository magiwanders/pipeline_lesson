## Important info on the virtual machine
The information that follows is not directly useful for the lesson but might be needed when operating the virtual machine:

**Some Ripes sub-windows, like the Pipeline Diagram one, DO NOT have the 'x' button to close them. Use the 'Esc' key.**

- The virtual machine only shows the ```Ripes``` program, which opens at startup. It will be needed in the second part of the lesson.
- Verify that the copy and paste functionality works between the host and the guest (it is simply easier to copy programs from this site to within ```Ripes```).
- Login credentials: 
    - user: ```student```
    - psw : ```student```
- System: ```Manjaro Linux i3 minimal updated september 2022```. Any modification or update is strongly advised against to preserve functionality.
- How to open a terminal:
    - ```Alt+2``` 
    - ```Alt+Enter```
    - The terminal is a standard linux terminal. If one desires to modify the i3 configuration, one has to modify the file ```~/.config/i3/config``` for example with the ```nano``` editor:
        - ```sudo nano ~/.config/i3/config```
- To return to Ripes in any moment:
    - ```Alt+1```
- If for any reason ```Ripes``` closes, reboot the virtual machine.
