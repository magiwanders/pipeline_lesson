# Register File (RF)

Design of the 32 bit RF by [Marek Materzok](https://github.com/tilk). This design is purely functional, it does not get to the level of detail of logic ports.
The register file contains the 32 registers that are referred to in the assembly code as x0-x31, or with the corresponding ABI names. What distinguishes the register file from a normal memory is that it can read to registers at once, while simultaneously writing another one.
