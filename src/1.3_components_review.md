# Review of Single Cycle Processor Components

The following pages contain interactive examples of these circuits:
- [32 bit Register](./1.4_single_register.md)
- [8 bit ROM](./1.5_rom.md)
- [32 bit Register File (RF)](./1.6_register_file.md)
- [8 bit PC](./1.7_pc.md)
- [32 bit ALU](./1.8_alu.md)

The circuits are implemented in S.H.E.A.S. (a simulation tool a tutorial for which you can find in the [Circuit Timing](./2_timing.md) section).
