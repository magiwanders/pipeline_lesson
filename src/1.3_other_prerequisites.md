# Other Prerequisites

Among the components of the single cycle processor that is advisable to know the innerworking of are:
- Single Registers
- Memories
- Register File (RS)
- PC
- ALU

This is a list of circuits in S.H.E.A.S. (a simulation tool a tutorial for which you can find in the [Temporizzazione](./2_timing.md) section).
- [Registro a 32 bit](./1.4_registro.md)
- [ROM a 8 bit](./1.5_rom.md)
- [Register File (RF) a 32 bit](./1.6_register_file.md)
- [PC a 8 bit](./1.7_pc.md)
- [ALU a 32 bit](./1.8_alu.md)
