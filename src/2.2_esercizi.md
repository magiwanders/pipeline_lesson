1. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the full adder circuit similar to that done for the xnor gate in the previous lesson. What propagation delay do you estimate? Here is an isolated full adder circuit, of which there are many inside the incrementer:

<div id="sheas_container_fulladder"><div style="width:100%; height:100%"><div class="loader"></div></div></div>

2. Does the overall propagation delay of the incrementer chip change for different inputs? If yes, with which criteria?
