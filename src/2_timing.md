# Circuit Timing

In your studies so far you have treated logic gates and circuits as instantaneous, which means they yield their result immediately after having received the inputs. However this is not the case in the real world, where circuits always have a non negligible propagation delay. What consequences does this have on the processor? In this chapter we will find out.

Make sure you have read [THIS](./5.3.1_sheas.md) to know how to use SHEAS properly.
