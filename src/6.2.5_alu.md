# ALU

32 bits ALU design by [Marek Materzok](https://github.com/tilk)). This design is purely functional, it does not get to the level of detail of logic ports.

The alu receives as input two values and a function to execute on them. The result is given as output, together with a flag that indicates if the result is zero.
